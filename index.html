			<div>John Monash:</div>
			<div>The Australian Icon</div>
		</h1>
		<p>John Monash is one of the most recognisable contemporary icons. He served Australia as a soldier, an engineer and a commissioner. Despite this status, his actions and ideas are not often discussed nor widely known outside of his military career.</p>
		<p>This website aims to explore the ways that Monash has influenced Australia through four perspectives, at four points of his life, and in four key turning points in Australian history: The erosion of English identity in Australia; Australia's involvement in the Great War; The construction of the Victorian grid; and the largest funeral procession in Australian history at the time. The interactive timeline below briefly outlines the context in which these four events took place. Click on the four major turning points to learn more about these aspects of his life.</p>
