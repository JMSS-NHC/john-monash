		<h2>
			An Infrastructural Dilemma
		</h2>
		<p>
			The development of electricity distribution in Victoria before the great war was unregulated and not yet standardised. Consumers relied on the different local power stations to supply their electricity, as large-scale transmission over the lines was deemed impractical for small-scale private enterprise. As a consequence of this it’s reported that “throughout the suburbs, [electrical current] phases were different. Electric fittings which would operate in Melbourne would not operate in Richmond, and fittings which operated in Richmond would not operate in Essendon. There was no area of the size of Melbourne whose electrical business was in such a chaotic and confused condition.”<sup>[1]</sup>
		</p>
		<p>
			This overall halted electrical and motorised development in Victoria, prompting the government to establish a commission to change the system for the benefit of Victorian businesses and households. The state at this point had been relying on New South Wales (NSW) to provide Victoria with black coal, for which it was spending 31s ($137 in 2017) per ton, and which was double the price at which NSW was paying for its own coal<sup>[2][3]</sup>. A major strike in NSW in 1907 epitomised “that [Victorian] industries, [Victorian] railway [...] and [Victorians’] home comfort are practically at the mercy of the New South Wales colliers,” despite the state’s having “vast deposits of brown coal, which could be easily handled and cheaply mined.”<sup>[4]</sup> The prospect of being self-sufficient hence became very important for the state.
		</p>
		<p>
			After Sir John Monash’s service in the war, the Victorian Government tasked him with the infiltration and intelligence collection of several brown coal mining sites throughout Germany<sup>[2]</sup>. With his fluency in the language and engineering knowledge, he submitted a report to the state outlining the potential for brown coal to be used as a resource for power generation, and the necessary infrastructure required for such an undertaking.

    <h2>The Grid</h2>
		<p>
      <i>
        “The commission would take every lawful means to protect the consumers of electricity against the danger of being overcharged for electric service [...] The commission was created primarily to assist the industrial development of the State, and the commission was resolved to ensure that supplies of industrial power should reach the consumer, wherever situated, at the lowest possible cost.”<sup>[5]</sup>
			</i>
		</p>
    <p>
      The Victorian government in 1919 established the State Electricity Commission (SEC) to overlook the development of electricity supply in Victoria. In late 1920, Sir John Monash was appointed the head of the commission due to his engineering knowledge, political activity and prior involvement in the project<sup>[6]</sup>. The State Electricity Commission set out to establish a grid which would provide a uniform, reliable, and affordable electricity supply to every home in Victoria.
    </p>
    <p>
      This vision consisted of a new major power plant being built in the Morwell region. There came to be a new township named Yallourn, a portmanteau of the Woiwurrung<sup>[7]<sup> words Yalin (then anglicised as Yalleen), meaning brown; and Lourn, meaning fire or charcoal. The town would be the site of open-cut brown coal mines, which would provide coal to be briquetted<sup>[8]</sup> in the town, burned in Morwell and Newport, then supplied to Victoria. This system, both closed and scalable, would be “capable of satisfying all possible requirements of the state for many generations to come.”<sup>[9]</sup> The SEC also planned a hydroelectric dam on the Goulburn river, and the Kiewa Hydroelectric Scheme which - in tandem with the Yallourn site - would help provide power to the rest of Victoria.

			    “[scalability was] one of the outstanding favourable features in connection with the Morwell project. The extent of the coal deposits capable of being worked on the open-cut principle is such that by the provision of adequate machinery, any increase in output above the proposed initial capacity can be produced [... it is] a storehouse of wealth and power which any state must deem if not only a good fortune to possess but a duty to develop for the use of the community” - From the Electricity Commissioners' report, Novemer 1919

			Unlike its predecessor supply lines, this new system would be a fully connected grid, allowing several generators to be connected to a statewide network. The infrastructure was built to deal with peak demand by having its Newport generator act only when necessary, otherwise relying solely on the Morwell and Sugarloaf stations<sup>[10]</sup>. By 1929, the grid had connected Victoria from Lakes Entrance to Port Fairy, to the NSW towns of Corowa, Albury and Moama. Scalability would further allow this far-reaching network to become the National Electricity Market Grid.

      Looking Outward
    </h2>
		<p>
			Monash’s role in the SEC entailed managing difficult public relations; the commission was certainly not without its critics. Monash sustained pressure from the public when the commission required six German engineers to come to Victoria to help establish the briquetting plant in Yallourn. His response came in a detailed statement conceding that “while no one desires a permanent influx into the Commonwealth of former enemy aliens” its was vital that the engineers provide Australia with their expert knowledge<sup>[11]</sup>. Aside from the public pressure, the Federal Government itself blocked the engineers from arriving in Australia “claiming as its authority an amendment to the Immigration Act.”<sup>[12]</sup>

					“To have asked our men to put such a machine together would have been like pulling a one hundred guinea watch to pieces, and then handing the parts to you and asking you to put it together” - John Monash, from a cross-examination during a 1926 inquiry.

    <p>
      The engineers did arrive and work in Australia for 12 months<sup>[13]</sup>, though clearly not without issue. Despite himself being of German heritage, Monash never addressed - or rather could not address - these attitudes from a humanitarian or personal perspective, rather a technical perspective. Despite himself having fought the Germans first hand however, he nonetheless did most openly welcome and employ the expertise of the German engineers; not for any reason other than that it was the only way for Victoria to get cheap reliable power.

      (Re)shaping a nation
    </h2>
    <p>
      This short episode in the story of the development of the Victorian grid reveals some of John Monash’s attitudes toward immigration and Australianism. For him, Australian patriotism and international collaboration were not mutually exclusive. This went against the cultural psyche which saw Australia as its own closed nation with ties only to England. Monash however would not let this get in the way of producing the highest quality coal briquettes possible. He made it very clear to the public that ensuring prosperity in Australia meant opening up to the outside world, and that foreign involvement was more important than national purism.
    </p>

      <i>
        “It is high time that the public of Australia should realise that the growth of its native industries depends far more upon the acquisition from abroad of expert and scientific knowledge and experience than upon tariffs. Australia could never have established ironworks, or spinning or weaving, or many other industries if it had had to depend on such knowledge as was available in Australia.” - From John Monash’s public statement, 1922
      </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Monash believed that xenophobia had blinded Australians from the reality of the benefits of foreign involvement. It is clear that he found Australia’s insular nature regressive and acting against its own interests, and was disappointed in his Government and his people for refusing the entry of professionals on the basis of “mere sentimental and temporary objection.” It is unclear whether Monash’s personal heritage played a role in his actions and beliefs, and whether he took anti-German attitudes personally to any extent. Nonetheless, he had the optimism to view this strain of racism as merely sentimental and temporary.
