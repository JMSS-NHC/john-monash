		An Infrastructural Dilemma
	</h2>
	<p>
		John Monash was one of the most important figures during the first world war. Using his military intelligence and creativity, Monashâ€™s ingenious military tactics single handedly turned the tide of the war just as hope had begun to fade within the Allied troops.
	</p>
	<p>
		The battle of Hamel, originally led by Field Marshal Douglas Haig, was an operation that saw the first use of mechanized weapons being used with infantry in tandem. This is considered by many as the first modern battle in the Great War. As technology advanced at a enormous pace, many of the powerful strategists in the military were left behind as their doctrines could not keep up with the pace that which new weapons are created everyday.
	</p>
	<p>
		This was a huge problem to the extent that, many of the British senior commanders such as General Haig, often ordered troops to stick together in formations of 3 ranks, which is standard to the formations used back in the 1800s to attack a machine gun nest. It is without question, that many soldiers perished from the inexperience of the commanders in the future. However, of all the people in senior command, John Monash was one of the only generals who saw the potential in new technologies such as tank as well as patrol planes in order to gain an advantage on the German machine guns.
	</p>
	<p>
		Using a combination of tanks and infantry, John Monash minimised the casualties during the Battle of Hamel as the infantry would stay behind tanks and eliminate any minor targets whilst the tanks acted as a shield and battery which could both protect infantry from fire as well as run over any gun emplacements or fortifications that the German had.
	</p>
	<p>
		John Monash also invented the first crude by effective real time intelligence. The system, as the name suggests, allows the commanders behind the lines to know in real time, what is happening on the battlefield in order to make any changes to the plan if necessary. This was done through the use of patrol planes who would take photos and have a record of enemy and allied activity and drop that information onto a designated hotspot where a motorcycle squad will pick up the notes and transfer it to HQ. In essence, this meant that the generals had a clear picture of where their units had advanced to and how well the plan is going.
	</p>
	<p>
		The battle of Hamel was of a great importance for the Allies, as the meticulous planning made by Sir John Monash and his staff were so brilliant that the British command soon adopted their strategy and made it compulsory for every officer in the army to bring with them a booklet detailing the strategy and tactics that John Monash utilised in the Battle of Hamel.
	</p>
	<p>
		In a war where both sides know only to throw bodies at each other, the battle of Hamel serves to demonstrate the capabilities and utility for the emerging technology at that time. It was essentially a playground for both mechanical and aerial units to show their effectiveness to their superiors.
